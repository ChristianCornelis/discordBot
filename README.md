# serviceBot
A simple Discord bot to collect information about users requiring services such as their name, address, date for required service, etc...

## Requirements
- A valid AWS account. Credentials must be stored in ~/.aws/credentials. A DynamoDB table named `services` is created as part of this application.
- The ability to add Discord Bots to your server :) (see [here](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot) for help)
- The client ID  generated by creating a new Bot application through the Discord Developer Portal
- The bot token generated by creating a new Bot through the Discord Developer Portal.
- A `config.json` at the root directory level that contains the key `token`, set to the bot token mentioned above.

## Installation
- Invite the Discord Bot to your server (see [here](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html#bot-invite-links) for help)
- Pull down the code, addressing all requirements above prior to running.
- Install `node` and `npm`.
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
- Run `node .` to start the bot!

## Usage
- `!service` will begin a conversation with ServiceBot
    - ServiceBot will then ask you to specify which type of service you require: `taxi`, `food delivery`, `home care`, or `cleaning`

- `!cancel` will cancel a service input.
- `!help` will show valid commands.
